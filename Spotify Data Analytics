# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#1. What song had the longest duration?

SELECT *
FROM  BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#2. What were the top 10 songs?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3. What is the average danceability by artist?

SELECT artist_name,
AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;
